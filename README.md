# ðŸ’» Pythonify (not yet)


Python is a code formatter for Python scripting language. It checks every line in the
Python file and owing to that, it determines what this code is lack of readability, or PEP8 styling, and formats it.

* PEP8 styling guide support.
* Formats your code to make it more clear, and beautiful.
* Uses Cython to interact with the hardware directly, rather Python itself.
* Makes recommendations to you to make you write better code.
* CLI Support

For short, with <a href="https://github.com/violencedev/pythonify">Pythonify</a> you will be able to code better than ever.
